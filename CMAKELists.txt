#[[
    When CMake processes a project source tree, the entry point is a source file called CMakeLists.txt 
    in the top-level source directory. This file may contain the entire build specification or 
    use the add_subdirectory() command to add subdirectories to the build. 
    Each subdirectory added by the command must also contain a CMakeLists.txt file as the entry point to that directory. 
    For each source directory whose CMakeLists.txt file is processed CMake generates 
    a corresponding directory in the build tree to act as the default working and output directory.]]

#[[The top-level CMakeLists.txt file for a project must contain a literal, direct call to the project() command; 
    loading one through the include() command is not sufficient.
    Call the project() command near the top of the top-level CMakeLists.txt, 
    but after calling cmake_minimum_required().]]
